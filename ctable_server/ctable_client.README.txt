package require ctable_client

    remote_ctable ctable://localhost:1999/flightPlans flightPlans

This creates a new command, flightPlans, that is mostly a mirror of the ctable 
foo on the remote machine (or on the same machine but in a different process.)

    remote_ctable_create localhost cable_info foo

Don't know if this even works anymore.



$ctable search {-sort -severity -compare {{>= severity 50}}} line {
    puts $line
}
