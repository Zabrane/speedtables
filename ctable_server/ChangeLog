    * Use a ctable://-style URL to identify the host, optional port, and
      remote table when specifying a table.

    * Support redirects in the client and server.

    * Make remote search support -tabsep, -code, -key, -array_get, -get and
      -array_get_with_nulls.  Note that -array_get actually doesn't currently
      exclude nulls.
