    * Add local "destroy" command to ctable client.
      This allows us to destroy the client without destroying the
      server. Kind of like the Neutron bomb.

    * Add remote "shutdown" and "redirect" to ctable server.
      And redirect ... -shutdown to kill both birds with one stone.

    * Make client *not* follow redirections for "shutdown" and "redirect".
      This allows us to attempt to shutdown a server without worrying
      about taking the wrong server out with friendly fire.

    * Make socket close always remove cached socket info in server.

    * Make socket close always remove cached table info in client.

    * Parse all the variants of the ctable://-style URL including host,
      optional port, directory, table name, and optional stuff.

    * Begin a common code package between the ctable client and server.

    * Use a ctable://-style URL to identify the host, optional port, and
      remote table when specifying a table.

    * Support redirects in the client and server.

    * Uplevel the code body when handling a remote ctable search with -code
      so that that code is at the right level to see variables in its context.

11/28/06 karl
    * Add an identifying message the ctable server sends upon connect
      that the client parses.

11/26/06 karl
    * Make remote search support -tabsep, -code, -key, -array_get, -get and
      -array_get_with_nulls.  Note that -array_get actually doesn't currently
      exclude nulls.
