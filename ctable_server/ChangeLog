    * Uplevel 1 the code body when handling a remote ctable search with -code
      so that that code is at the right level to see variables in its context.

    * Make remote search support -tabsep, -code, -key, -array_get, -get and
      -array_get_with_nulls.  Note that -array_get actually doesn't currently
      exclude nulls.
