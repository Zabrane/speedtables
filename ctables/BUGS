"exists" method does not check argument count
-- fixed

-noKeys in one place, -nokeys in another, the style elsewhere is 
like -with_key_fields.

-- Good point. Probably best to get rid of the double negative implication and standardize on -with_key_fields or simplify to -with_keys.

Needs to be a way to tell read_tabsep that the fieldnames are the first line
and have it work with a key field defined and not.

-- Agreed.

I think if you're doing a $table search -delete 1, it should probably
return the number of rows deleted.  However, adding -countOnly 1 makes
it return that number, but no deletes occur.

-- I think -countOnly is a bit confusing, and redundant. If there is a code body the value should be the value of the body, otherwise it should always be a count.

---- But what count?  Aren't you overloading count, or, oh, the number of
rows matched.  hmm.
