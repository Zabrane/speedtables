"exists" method does not check argument count

-noKeys in one place, -nokeys in another, the style elsewhere is 
like -with_key_fields.

Needs to be a way to tell read_tabsep that the fieldnames are the first line
and have it work with a key field defined and not.

I think if you're doing a $table search -delete 1, it should probably
return the number of rows deleted.  However, adding -countOnly 1 makes
it return that, so maybe that's right, but I don't think so.
