    * Generate enum entries for fields using a proc.  That proc makes the
      field names unique, for example, FIELD_MAC now becomes for table
      "cable_device", FIELD_CABLE_DEVICE_MAC.

    * Add new "array_get" method that will let you one or more fields,
      or all fields, in "array get" format, i.e. key value [key value...]"

    * Make it work under FreeBSD as well as Darwin.  Eventually we will
      have to at least parse tclConfig.sh and possibly even have our
      own GNU autoconf thang.

    * Emit a enumerated typedef for the CTable types.  Also enumerate
      a corresponding array of char pointers containing the type names.

    * Emit an enum *_types for each defined table that has the enumerated
      ctable type for each field in the table.  This will allow us at
      runtime to easily and efficiently determine the type of any field from 
      C.  Soon, from Tcl as well.

    * Add of new method, fieldtype, which will return the CTable type of
      the passed-in field.

    * Add of new method, needs_quoting, which returns one if the passed-in
      field requires or may require quoting (i.e. could contain characters
      that could trip up a database insert, CSV export, or something like
      that.)
