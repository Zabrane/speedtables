Rather than shipping a 24 meg file in the bigtests directory, we provide
a mechanism for generating the test dataset algorithmically.

gen1000knames.tcl will randomly generate a million names and goofy user IDs.

By forcing the seed of random number generator at startup, however, it will
always generate the same data the same way, unless somebody's Tcl 
implementation doesn't produce the same set of random numbers for the same
seed.  If this does occur, we can replace the call to rand() with our own
written in Tcl or even use the rand stuff we ship with ctables.
