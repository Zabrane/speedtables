These have evolved from the jsw skip list routines in the public domain from
the Internet.

They have certain problems.  They're completely and utterly broken in a 
multithreaded or muti-process shared-memory environment because they have 
all sorts of assumptions that there's one connection, like stuff that should 
be a per-user kind of thing, such as a cursor and a recent traversal cache,
are stuck there in the skip list structure.

I cvs tagged them jsw_slib_before_lists while they were still pretty
general purpose.  They're useful enough that having skip lists with
only objects on their backsides would be valuable.

Code changes after the tag, these skip lists are going to have integral 
doubly linked lists via the ctable_baseRow structure i.e. very
tied to ctables.
