meta table - a Tcl command that can define tables.  Automatically generated
C code.

table - a Tcl command generated by the "create" method of a meta table.
It is an instance of a table and contains zero or more rows.

The table has "get" and "set" methods that can fetch and store values into
a row of a table, and can also create, delete, and initialize rows.

row - a C struct containing some fields.



On the Mac, here's how we compile and link:

gcc -pipe -Wall -Wno-implicit-int -fno-common -c urk.c -o urk.o

gcc -pipe -dynamiclib  -Wall -Wno-implicit-int -fno-common  -Wl,-single_module -o urk4.0.dylib urk.o -L/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.4 -ltclstub8.4 -ltcl

I've decided to punt on the fancy linked lists and cursors for this version.

I'm going to just use hashtables for indexing stuff and there will be
one and only one key per row.

A future version will have cursors and more fanciness.

Oh my god it's working.

Now I want to add a new method for tables, type, which will return the
name of the table type.

Also "fields" for the meta table and maybe the generated table as well.

Also "delete"

Also perhaps "exists".

"type" and "delete" are done.  delete returns 1 if it deleted, 0 if it didn't
exist.


Wed Jun 28 02:53:00 CDT 2006

"exists" is done and works

added a "statistics" method to get hash statistics a la arrays

Added a "fields" method to get field names in the order defined, as a list,
from a table

Add a foreach or something to walk the array.  Also add a search capability.

if you do a create and the name is #auto, generate the name a la incr tcl

implement IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses natively as 4 byte and 6 byte or
whatever types, with conversion.

Added "names" -- yes it generates a list that will be gross but it was
quick and actually provides basic functionality.



Have tclobj as a datatype as well, it'll incr the reference count of the
object and squirrel away a pointer to it.  This'll let people pass in
lists and stuff they don't want to crack out.

foreach done

destroy done

reset done
