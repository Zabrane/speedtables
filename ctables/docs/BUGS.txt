It should detect using the same field name more than once in a table definition.

FIXED When searching, array_get_with_nulls and array_get don't include the 
      fieldnames if a list of fields is specified.

FIXED Boolean retrieval isn't correct in search.  more to the point, it looks
      like boolean importing from postgres isn't working.

Is "definition" documented and does it work?
