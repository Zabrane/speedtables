It should detect using the same field name more than once in a table definition.

FIXED When searching, array_get_with_nulls and array_get don't include the 
      fieldnames if a list of fields is specified.

FIXED Boolean retrieval isn't correct in search.  more to the point, it looks
      like boolean importing from postgres isn't working.

Is "definition" documented and does it work?

[peter] You mean {meta_table cextension}?

gen_null_check_during_set_source and gen_unset_null_during_set_source
need to not generate index management code if the field isn't indexable.

trying to define an index on a boolean should generate an error
