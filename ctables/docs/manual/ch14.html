<H2>15 - Acknowledgements</H2>
<p>I would like to acknowledge Peter da Silva, the first outside user of speed tables and the first person to use them in real production code with millions of rows of data.</p>
<p>His insight and experience greatly contribute to the design and evolution of the technology. In particular, thanks to him it is easier to use, more capable, faster, and more memory-efficient.</p>
<p>He's contributed a lot on the client/server side, making it possible to "fail over" to a new server-side speed table definition in a very transparent way.</p>
<p>In addition, the query optimizer was completely his idea and implementation.</p>
