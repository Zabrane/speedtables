<H2>1 - speed tables - a High-performance, Memory-resident Database</H2>
<div class="blue">This chapter gives an overview of speed tables and describes the sort of applications they are useful for.</div>

<p>Speed tables provides an interface for defining <i>tables</i>
containing zero or more <i>rows</i>, with each row containing one
or more <i>fields</i>. The speed table compiler reads the table
definition and generates C code to create and manage corresponding
structures, currently producing a set of C access routines and a C
language extension for Tcl to create, access and manipulate those
tables. It then compiles the extension, links it as a shared library,
and makes it loadable on demand via Tcl's "package require"
mechanism.</p>

<p>Speed tables are well-suited for applications for which this
table/row/field abstraction is useful, with row counts from the
dozens to the tens of millions, for which the performance requirements
for access or update frequency exceed those of the available SQL
database, and the application does not require "no transaction loss"
behavior in the event of a crash.</p>

<div class="blue-indent">Example Application</div>
<p class="blue-block">Speed Tables is used as a high-speed cache that front-ends a SQL database for a website generating millions of customized page views per day using commodity hardware.</p>

<p>In contrast to ad-hoc tables implemented with some combination
of <i>arrays</i>, <i>lists</i>, <i>upvar</i>, <i>namespaces</i>,
or even using <i>dicts</i>, Speed tables' memory footprint is far
smaller and performance far higher when many rows are present.</p>
<p>Speed tables support tab-separated reading and writing to files
and TCP/IP sockets, and has a direct C interface to PostgreSQL.
Examples are provided for importing SQL query results into a speed
table as well as copying from a speed table to a database table.
Speed tables' search function provides a number of powerful
capabilities including results sorting, setting offsets and limits,
specifying match expressions, and counting.</p>
