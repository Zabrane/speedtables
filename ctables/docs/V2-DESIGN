Ctable 2 takes lessons learned from Ctable 1.

A bunch of things that are custom-generated in Ctable 1 will not be custom-generated in Ctable 2.

Ctable 2 will generate, for each table type...

   a search compare routine.

   a sort compare routine.

   A routine to get a field's value into an object based on a row pointer and field number.

A routine to create a tab-separated DString from a row pointer and a list of fields.

A routine to fetch all the values in a row into a Tcl list.

A routine to fetch all the field names and values in a row into a Tcl list.

A routine to fetch all the non-null field names and values in a row into a Tcl list.

A routine to lappend a field name and value to a destination list given a row pointer and a field.

A routine to lappend a field name and value to a destination list given a row pointer and a field if the field is not null.

Most/all of the rest of the capabilities will be built up without resorting to generating code.
