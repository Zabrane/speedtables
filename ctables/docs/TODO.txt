DONE a lot of those emit_set_*_field routines are basically the same and can
be replaced by one that specifies which variable containing source for
setting that field type needs to be substituted.

be able to import from an array, including only specific variables

DONE be able to get fields from a row in array get format

ALREADY DONE - IT's INHERENT be able to import key-value pairs in array 
get/set format 

Add a way for someone doing a CTable definition to specify additional
files to include.

Add a way to write methods in C and add additional C code to the stuff
being generated, from the CTable definition.

DONE make the *_init routine have a static internal copy of an initialization
row and a static saying if it's been generated or not.  generate it
the first time.  from then on, don't generate, but always do a structure
copy of the pregenerated initialized row to the new row being initialized.

DONE when issuing a bad something parsing something, maybe include the bad
value itself.

create a direct interface to postgresql "copy in".  Make it optional.

    We'd escape all of the strings that could contain escape characters,
    i.e. strings, but not integers, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.

    You'd pass us a connection handle and you'd have already issued the
    "copy in" so the channel would be in copy_in state, and we'll
    call PQputCopyData repeatedly and then PQputCopyEnd and send you
    back the result / error, etc.

    You'd probably tell us how many rows to batch in a single put
    (they can be separated by a newline) or max bytes or something
    like that.

    Also you'd probably also want to do the reverse, copy in.

create a direct interface to reading and writing CSV or tab-separated or 
whatever.

DONE make all the types able to return text, not just to generate tcl object's.
     from that, make a function that returns "CONST char *" for all the types.
    NOTE - after looking at the Tcl core, how they do the Tcl_PrintDouble
    function is to actually hoke up a Tcl object and get Tcl to create
    a string representation in the object.  We can't do that unless we
    access Tcl internals.  Looks like we might be doing a lot of mallocing
    if we want to be thread safe.

DONE make a way to find out the types of fields and whether quoting may be
    required (i.e. not for ints, floats, macs, inets, needed for strings)
    DONE create enumerated list of types that are supported.
    DONE create a table that allows conversion between enumerated ctable and
         their textual equivalents.
    DONE fieldtype method returns the ctable type name for the passed-in field

DONE since we will want Tcl_Objs with the names of the fields pretty often,
at startup time generate them and increment their reference counts so
they'll be kept around forever.

DONE factor out the get routine as the set routine was factored out earlier and
then use it from the big GET case statement.  This will facilitate using
this stuff from C as well as having alternative ways to get stuff, like,
for example, a routine that gets stuff in "array set" format and a routine
that gets stuff for CSV output and stuff like that.

DONE When we have default string values, create a Tcl_Obj with that string value
and increment the reference count once, then when feeding a default string
value to something fetching it, instead of doing a Tcl_NewStringObj on the
default string, simply give the pointer to the pre-set Tcl_Obj.

Do a thing like lassign where you can set fetched fields into variables.
(Fairly unimportant as you can easily lassign the result of a "get")

Make set return a 1 if it created the row and a 0 if it already exists.
(Uh, not sure how valuable this actually is.)

Make an export function that works like import insofar as calling code
repeatedly with the field names preparsed.

DONE factor the get value stuff a little better.  right now the only way you
     can get a value is to cause it to be lappended onto the Tcl result object.
     We need this to be more usable from C.  You need to be able to pass it
     an object to set into.  Also, for strings, you need to be able to get
     a pointer to the string and a length, plain and simple.

Make it work with UTF8 chars.

DONE Scarf off the ctable definition and if the one we're fed next compares
     identically, avoid generating, compiling and linking it.

DONE keep track of the version info on the generator and force a rebuild if
     it's changed.  this way if the generator is updated we rebuild even if
     code body is identical.

Expanding on the previous thing, also make sure the C source file and the
shared library is newer than the scarfed file and that the CVS version
of gentable that the stuff was built with hasn't altered.  This way if
the build previously failed for some reason or the version of gentable
got updated, that we still regenerate the shared library.

Catch tracebacks and don't emit the entire traceback unless asked to or
something.

DONE Add the build path to the auto path if it isn't already there.

DONE Rework this whole default value thing.  Or maybe the null value is in 
     addition to the default value.  The point is that for doubles and stuff 
     like that, if we're getting fed from a database, there can be null 
     values for stuff besides varstrings.  For example when reading cable 
     modem data, if we don't have a status of "registration complete", we have 
     null values for the signal-to-noise and transmit power and the like.

Have a way to find out if a field is null out-of-band, that is, some kind of
method called is_null or the like that will tell if you if a field or fields
is null.

DONE Create something like array_get_nonnull or a switch.

DONE Gotta make varstrings be able to be defined without defaults and still
     work properly with the whole null thing.

It's easy to make the null_value setting be local to an instance of the
table and not global to all tables of a specific type.  tbl_ptr is defined
in the big case statement -- 

DONE It's an error to not define at least one field.
