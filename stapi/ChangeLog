    Add support for the PostgreSQL "name" and "text" data types by mapping
    them to ctable's "varstring".  

    Add support for the PostgreSQL "oid" data type by mapping it to ctable's
    "int".

    Change the mapping for the PostgreSQL "int2" data type from the ctable
    "int" to the ctable "short" type.

    Change the mapping for the PostgreSQL "bool" data type from the ctable
    "varstring" to the ctable "boolean", a huge win for booleans, dropping
    their per-row overhead from a point, a length, and allocated memory
    to a single bit.

    Split half of "sql_ctable_get" into "sql_create_sql" and use that from
    "sql_ctable_agwn" instead of calling "sql_ctable_get", so that we can
    distinguish "no data" from "empty list".

9/17/2008 peter
    Added "-nocomplain" option to sql_get_one_tuple to allow for ctable
    array_get_with_nulls to return "" for a missing key rather than
    erroring out.

    Several fixes in key handling in STDisplay

3/04/2008 peter
    Make "List" the default for STDisplay.

12/14/2007 karl
    * Install by default to /usr/local/lib not /usr/fa/lib.

10/4/2007 peter
    Remove optimizer completely, it's been moved to speedtables.

    Extract this ChangeLog from CVS.

8/10/2007 peter
    stapi front end for shared tables

    ::stapi::connect shared://port/table ?-build build_path?

    Can accept "localhost:port", for consistency.

7/18/2007 peter
    Bulk rename "sttp" to "stapi".

7/11/2007 peter
    Don't call remote ctable from inside remote ctable code block. o_O

7/11/2007 peter
    * Made sttp consistent with ctables, if there's no simple key then it
      simulates the ctables "_key" field.

7/10/2007 peter
    Removed "perform" and "fetch" and dependencies on it to simplify the
    API and make it easier to implement in ctables.
    Removed the array versions of "store" and "makekey" for the same reason.

7/9/2007 peter
    Support new ctable "key" command.

6/7/2007 peter
    Document the extensions to search and reference the optimizer.

2/28/2007 peter
    Merging "sttpx" into "sttp" - it's silly having an "extended" version
    of something that's not even released. :)

2/6/2007 peter
    Remove dependance on sc_postgres.

1/24/2007 peter
    Splitting speedcache into sttp[_server|_client|_display]

    Working STDisplay with "sql:" URLs.

1/19/2007 peter
    Working sql: URLs.

    Hack reduction: remove CableAware glue from connect_ctable, create
    ::scache::register and move the glue to glue.tcl as connect_cache.
    Get rid of "/var/tmp/speedcache", if you don't specify a cache
    location it'll use the local directory.

1/15/2007 peter
    ctable connection wrapper:
      ::scache::connect URL ?options?

    URL formats:
      ctable://...
        cttp URI
      sql://user:passwd@host:db/table/...
        direct SQL connection Not implemented
      local:///ctable
        reference to already-opened ctable

    more to come.

    Q: should "ctable:" be "cttp:"?


1/5/2007 peter
    Import from CableAware.

    Remove the "helper" routine for generating the ctable from sql because
    it's based on the cable-aware cache.cfg file format.
    Replaced with a "glue" routine in glue.tcl, and a routine for creating
    the column-list format for a ctable from the sql database and
    optional arguments.
